# QrCode-Generator
In this project we have created and qrcode generator progrom using python. We need to install 2 module ( qrcode [pip install qrcode] and image [pip install image]). After the 
installation of the modules we need to import them into our program. The editor used is VScode and then proceed with further coding.
